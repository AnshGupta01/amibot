## What are the ways in which I can contribute to this project?

This might be the question in your head when you were going through the code of AMIBOT.

Well, its very simple.

#### If you are a complete beginner, you can just open up the readme file or any such documentation file and look for any typing or grammatical errors in them. 

If present, just fork this repository, create a new branch and edit the file to rectify those specific errors. Once that is done, commit the changes to the file and simply create a pull request to get it merged if it is a valid error.


#### And if you are an intermediate in Javascript, then?

Well then you can go through the .js files and check if any code is having any error or if it can be written in a more neat way to make it look more appealing and/or shorten it.


#### More advanced JS user? 

Write codes that can be added to the AMIBOT to increase its functionalities. The features that can be implemented in future are given at the end of the readme.md file, so do check them out.
